Simulating Aquaculter Production spread sheets for ocean cage production

Simulation of Aquaculture Production is a series of three .Excel spreadsheets for simulating the production of sea bass (D. Labrax) in cages in the open sea. It provides insight into aquaculture production and business simulations.

3 example are currently  at ZOO-TECH,  SIM_REAL and  SAP (still under construction) documentation is being updated  and is currently at SAP Documentation. Download.

Zoo-Tech is an introductory spread sheet  applications applied to marine aquaculture production. It provides important, easy to understand calculations with user controlled information.

The simulation uses 5 sheets is and is based upon a site’s

    Thermal Profile, (mean weekly temperature in C°, by week, by year.),

    Daily Growth Model which  is a : general growth model for Sea Bass (D. labrax) weighing between 1 and 500 grams and a temperature between 14.5 and 26 °C.  The Model, is obtained from Leclercq & Tanguy, calculates the weekly weight gain but by changing parameters it is possible to simulate other species growth function.

    Daily Feeding Table (the mean fish weight (row), the temperature (column) and the (manufacture’s), suggested daily percentage (intersection) of food based upon the Biomass (number of individuals times their weight). This calculates into Kilos of food to distribute which calculates cost s and sales considerations.

    Plus other information and models for example which calculate food to nitrate production, ammonium and organic nitrogen production rate,  particulate matter production,  oxygen consumption and even the mean weekly current speed (minimum in meters/hour).

The user can vary most simulation parameters

SIM_REAL Combines REAL weekly production data, (i.e. number of fish moved (in/out), mortality, mean weight and kilos of food distributed) with user controlled initial data (i.e. starting date, number initial, etc.)  the user can quickly summarize production for short-term results based upon real and current trends.
In many simulations, each week’s calculated results are based upon the previous weeks result’s.  This can cause the simulated results to “drift” each week from the actual production data.   After several months the simulated results could vary greatly from real production data.
